<p>Even today there isn't a single type of subway car on the New York subway lines. There are two main reasons for this: 1) Cars have to fit within the structure of lines built to different specifications by 3 separate tunneling companies; and 2) The city hires different contractors to build the cars themselves. So New Yorkers have to live with subways with different seat configurations and subway lines without countdown clocks. They say variety is the spice of life.</p>
